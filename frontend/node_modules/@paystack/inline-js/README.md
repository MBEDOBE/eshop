# Inline JS

This is the client-side JS library for loading the Paystack checkout form. It makes it easy to accept payments from a web application and to create custom, secure payment experiences for merchant apps and websites.

# Quick start
### Requirements

 ```
 node >= 12.0.0
 npm >= 6.0.0
 ```
### Setup

Clone this repository 

    git clone https://github.com/PaystackHQ/inline-js.git

Install dependencies with:

    npm install

# Local development

To test Inline JS locally, run the command;
```
npm run dev
``` 
This spins up a `http-server` serving the `dev` folder and you can then visit the different `HTML` files in that folder to test various APIs and payment flows.


### Testing

This project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit testing. To run all tests, use the command;
```
npm test
```
